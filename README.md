# one-hot-encoding

The machine cannot understand words and therefore it needs numerical values so as to make it easier for the machine to process the data. To apply any type of algorithm to the data, we need to convert the categorical data to numbers. To achieve this, one hot ending is one way as it converts categorical variables to binary vectors.
